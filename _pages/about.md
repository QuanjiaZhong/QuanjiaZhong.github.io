I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Ocean Science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, jointly advised by Prof. [Johnny C. L. Chan](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see/people/prof-johnny-c-l-chan) and Prof. [Jianping Gan](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/people/faculty/profile/magan/). Prior to joining HKUST, I conducted postdoctoral research at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Ruiqiang Ding and Prof. [Wansuo Duan](https://labesm-staff.iap.ac.cn/duanws/index/article/index/arid/1.html). I completed my Ph.D. at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. [Ruiqiang Ding](https://geot.bnu.edu.cn/Public/htm/news/5/1028.html). During my PhD studies, I was awarded a China Scholarship Council fellowship to visit the University of Oklahoma, where I conducted research on ensemble prediction under the supervision of Prof. [Xuguang Wang](https://www.ou.edu/ags/meteorology/people/faculty/xuguang-wang). I received my master’s degree from the PLA University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Lifeng Zhang, and my bachelor’s degree from Guangdong Ocean University.
